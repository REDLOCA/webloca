**Welcome,**

The **30th Meeting of the EURO Working Group on Locational Analysis** will take place in Jerez de la Frontera (Spain) from 17 to 19 September 2025. This periodic meeting of EURO Working Group on Locational Analysis (EWGLA) gathers researchers focused on Locational Analysis and its applications.

This year the meeting will be celebrated jointly with the **XIV International Workshop on Locational Analysis and Related Problems (IWOLOCA)**. This activity is organized by the Spanish Network on Location and Related Problems (**REDLOCA**) and **GELOCA**, the Spanish Operations Research Society working group on Location.

The EWGLA group holds meetings every 1.5 years. Anyone interested in presenting their work, participating in the discussions, or simply learning about subjects related with locational analysis may join the group. The IWOLOCA workshops are organized annually to promote communication among REDLOCA and GELOCA members and international researchers. The last meeting took place in Granada (Spain) in September 2024.
