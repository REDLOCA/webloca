### XIII International Workshop on Locational Analysis and Related Problems

The XIII International Workshop on Locational Analysis and Related Problems will be celebrated in Granada (Spain) 4-6 September 2024. This is an activity organized by the Spanish Network on Location and Related Problems and GELOCA, the SEIO working group on Location. These organizations involve Spanish researchers focused on locational analysis and other related problems, organized in 6 thematic nodes and distributed among several Spanish universities. Every year, the Network organizes a meeting to promote communication among its members and between them and other researchers, including an important number of international researchers, and to contribute to the development of the location field and related problems. The last meeting took place in Edinburgh (UK) in September 2023.

The topics of interest are location analysis and problems related to it. This includes location models, networks, transportation, logistics, exact and heuristic solution methods, and computational geometry, among others. Researchers and practitioners are invited to present works in the form of oral communications or posters. For participation, the submission of a short abstract is required.
